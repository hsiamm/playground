			<div class="intro">
				<p>How will the church respond to the needs of people today, as the suburbs shrink and cities expand? Matt Carter and Darrin Patrick challenge Christians and church leaders to take a second look at the church's calling and responsibility for the renewal and restoration of the city. Hear their stories and learn how you and your entire church can faithfully proclaim the gospel while living out the reality of a community changed and transformed by its message.</p>
