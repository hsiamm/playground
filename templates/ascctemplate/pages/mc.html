            <p>The Austin Stone is a network of missional communities â€“ small groups of people, joined by the gospel, pursuing the renewal and redemption of their community together. Missional community is the primary way to connect with others at The Austin Stone and pursue life on mission together.</p>

            <p>Missional Community is at the heart of living out the mission and vision that God has given The Austin Stone. We cannot do what God has called us to do alone. Jesus calls His people to live in community, living life together as we seek to share the gospel with our friends, neighbors, coworkers and city.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="twocol">
            <p>We want to be a movement: we want to be rapidly growing, dynamic, multiplying disciples &ndash; just like the early church. To do this, every believer has to get involved in the mission.</p>
