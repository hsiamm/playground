			<p>After outgrowing our initial space at Fulmore Middle School, The Austin Stone Community Church decided to move to Austin High School to accommodate for growth. The Downtown Campus remains our largest campus and meets right in the heart of downtown Austin.</p>
			
			<p>We offer four services; the 9am, 11:15am and 7pm services include live preaching, while the 5pm service is a video service. All services feature live worship. The Downtown Campus is primarily made up of families, singles and college students from central and south Austin.</p>

			<p>Our St. John Campus was purposefully built to serve the St. John neighborhood. This permanent campus shares a space with <a href="http://forthecity.org">The For the City Network</a> where non-profit organizations work alongside the church for efforts of restoration and renewal of the area.</p>
			
			<p>All four services at the St. John Campus are video services featuring live worship. This campus is primarily made up of families, singles and students from central and north Austin, and the northern suburbs.</p>

Recognizing a similar vision for the renewal and restoration of the city of Austin, Austin Bible joined The Austin Stone to become our West Campus location.</p>
			
			<p>We currently have one video service at 10am at the West Campus. This service also features live worship. This campus is primarily made up of families and singles from west, southwest and central Austin.</p>

			<h2 class="twenty">On Sundays</h2>
			<p>Sundays are a great time to gather together for worship, and we want to make sure you’re able to easily find your way around each campus. Here are a few hints to help navigate our Sunday morning services.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="clear:both;"></div>

			<img src="../images/sunday_signs.png" width="70" height="70" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 70px 0;" />
			<h2 class="nomar blue nocap">Follow The Signs</h2>
			<p>We've setup directional signage throughout our campuses to help you find your way. If you arrive early, follow the arrows to the <em>Welcome Center</em> &ndash; it's a good place to hang out until the service starts. We provide coffee at each campus, and friendly volunteers are available to answer any questions you have.</p>
			
			<div class="bump"></div>
			
			<img src="../images/sunday_welcome.png" width="70" height="70" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 80px 0;" /> 
			<h2 class="nomar blue nocap">Welcome Team</h2>
			<p>We desire for our church culture to be welcoming and warm, and our welcome team members lead in creating that culture. They are walking knowledge banks, able to help you find your way and answer questions. Look for a smiling face attached to a name tag; they would love to meet you!</p>
			
			<div class="bump"></div>			
			
			<img src="../images/sunday_coffee.png" width="70" height="70" style="float:left;margin:0 20px 20px 0;" />
			<h2 class="nomar blue nocap">Coffee</h2>
			<p>We serve coffee each Sunday made by a local coffee shop and non-profit partner of the Austin Stone. Pick up a cup in the Welcome Center before the service.</p>

			<h2 class="nomar blue nocap">TeenRock</h2>
			<p>If your child is between 6th&ndash;12th grade, make sure to check out our TeenRock ministry. At all of our campuses, TeenRock holds its own worship service with teaching that is specifically intended for all teens navigating this important and unique stage of life.</p>

			<h2 class="nomar blue nocap">Kidstuff</h2>
			<p>At The Austin Stone, rather than simply babysitting, we believe in actively teaching your children and supporting your leadership as parents. If you have  a child between the ages of 8 weeks to the 5th grade, follow the signs to the KidStuff check-in area. Our KidStuff staff would love to meet you and tell you about what we provide for your kids.</p>

				<h2 class="twenty">First Tuesdays</h2>
				<p>Join us on the first Tuesday of each month at 7pm for our monthly prayer and worship service. Each month we spend time together as a church body praying for God to do things in our lives and in the world around us greater than what we can do on our own. We‘ll be meeting at our St John Campus at 7pm. The map below shows the location of the facility.</p>
