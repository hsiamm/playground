				<h2 class="faq">WHY ARE WE HAVING EASTER SERVICE AT THE ERWIN CENTER?</h2>
				<p>This Easter, we'll have more people worshipping together than we have the capacity to handle at our 3 campuses. This is a unique opportunity to bring our entire body together for one service, in one building, at one time, at the Frank Erwin Center in the heart of Austin.</p>
				
				<p>We'll have plenty of seats and plenty of parking for you to bring your family, friends, co-workers, and neighbors with you as we celebrate the most pivotal event in all of history â€“ the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

				<h2 class="faq">WHY IS THERE NO CHILDCARE FOR 4th & 5th GRADE?</h2>
				<p>Our usual KidStuff Sunday program extends through 5th grade. However, we expect more children this year than last and our available space is limited. We are inviting our 4th and 5th graders to attend service with their parents to ensure that there is enough room for all our younger children.</p>
