			<h2 class="faq">why are we having our Easter service at the erwin center?</h2>
			<p>This Easter, we'll have more people worshipping our risen Lord together than we have capacity available in all the services at both of our campuses. So, this year we have a unique opportunity to come together for one service at the Frank Erwin Center in the heart of Austin.</p>
			
			<p>We'll have plenty of seats and plenty of parking for you to bring your family, friends, co-workers, and neighbors with you as we celebrate the most pivotal event in all of history &ndash; the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
