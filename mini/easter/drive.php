					Our response to God's grace through the resurrected Christ is to share the good news! We do this by sharing what has happened and how Christ is changing our lives. We also do this by serving our city as a demonstration of the redemption and restoration that He will bring to the world.

					As you celebrate Easter this year, please also join us in serving our city.  The For the City Network has many ways to get involved in a variety of areas and be "for the city" year-round.  A great first step to serve Austin is by bringing non-perishable food items and hygiene products to the Frank Erwin Center on Easter Sunday. 
				</p>

				<p>
					These items will be donated to the Capital Area Food Bank, one of the nonprofits at The For the City Center. The CAFB distributes 70,000 lbs. of food per day to over 48,000 people every week as part of its mission to nourish hungry people and lead the community in ending hunger.
