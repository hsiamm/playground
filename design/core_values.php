			<h1>Our Core Values</h1>

		<div class="twocol nomar">
			<p>All of our ministries at The Austin Stone have been arranged around these four elements of redemptive life. We live out these values personally, locally and globally for the glory of God and edification of the Church.</p>

			<h2 class="nomar blue">Worship Christ</h2>
			<p>Above all else, we at The Austin Stone are about Jesus. Everyone worships something. We worship what we treasure, what we value most. As believers, we worship Christ because He is the only One truly worthy of such a high level of devotion and affection. <em>&ldquo;&hellip;In Him, the fullness of God dwells in bodily form.&rdquo;</em> (Colossians 2:9)</p>
			<p>Worshipping Christ is the cornerstone of our church. If God is calling you to come on mission with us, He’s calling you first and foremost to be a worshipper of Christ.</p>
			
			<div class="bump">&nbsp;</div>	
			
			<h2 class="nomar blue">Live in Community</h2>
			<p>Living in community is the biblical model we see throughout Scripture, first in the Trinity and then in the New Testament Church. Living in Community for the glory of God is one of our best arguments for Jesus among our unbelieving friends and family.</p>
			<p>God created us to live in community, and we most effectively live out our mission as the family of God, together.</p>

			<h2 class="nomar blue">Get Trained</h2>
			<p>We believe that every saint (believer) is called to be a minister of the Gospel, and so every saint must pursue training and discipline to be an effective minister. It is the call of every believer to participate in God’s work through the church.</p>
			<p>We value getting trained for ministry so that we can put what we know about Him into practice for the building up and edification of the Church.</p>
			
			<div class="bump">&nbsp;</div>	
			
			<h2 class="nomar blue">Make Disciples</h2>
			<p>To make disciples literally means “to make learners.” We see what it means to make disciples from The Great Commission in Matthew 28:18&ndash;20 and in Acts 1:8. We must live on mission personally, locally and globally, to make much of Christ and bring Him glory.</p>
			<p>We believe Christ deserves worship from everyone on earth, and as long as there are people not yet worshipping Him, we still have work to do. It is our desire to complete the task that God has given the Church, to preach the gospel to all nations, and hasten the return of Christ! We are all called to make disciples, wherever we are.</p>
