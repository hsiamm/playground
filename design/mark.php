			<p>Dear Church,</p>
	
			<p>I am so excited for us to be moving forward from our 4 week From Israel Series into the Gospel of Mark.  We just spent four weeks engaging one of the most important questions Jesus asked, "Who do you say that I am?"  The Gospel of Mark will help us answer that question by showing us who Jesus is and what He came to do. I wanted to share with you a few distinctives of this gospel and what we are called to do in response.</p> 
			
			<p>The Gospel of Mark, like all the other Gospels shows us that Jesus is the Christ.  He is the anointed one.  He is the King of the Kingdom that will be established forever. The Gospel of Mark is unique because it highlights Jesus not as a King who came to be served, but as a King who came to serve.  In this Gospel, it reveals Jesus to be the suffering servant more so than in the other Gospels.  Mark also shows that Godâ€™s Kingdom is a Kingdom on the move with more than a third of the gospel comprised of Jesus' healings and miracles.</p>  
			
			<p>This Gospel will challenge us not to be stagnant, but a church of God on the move. That church is for the city and the nations, moving to accomplish the Mission that God has given us. It will challenge us to accomplish the Mission the way Jesus accomplished his mission: not through being served, but through serving.</p>
			
			<p>Our response to the Gospel of Mark is a call to humble obedience and action. We are called to live like Jesus not just once in a while, not just sometimes, but all the time, everywhere. Because Jesus is our King, He demands that we live a life of obedience. However, because He is our King who suffered to make us Holy, He enables us to live that life of obedience.</p>
			
			<p>Church, this is an exciting time and we ask that you continue to pray for radical obedience in your lives and guidance for our leadership as we dive into the Gospel of Mark.</p> 
			
			<p>For His Glory,<br>
			<em>matt</em></p>
