			<h2 class="nomar blue">What Is Partnership?</h2>
			<p>Partnership at The Austin Stone is a covenant with our church community towards seeing the kingdom of God expand in the city of Austin and in the nations. The Austin Stone's mission is to be a New Testament church that exists for the supremacy of the name and purpose of Jesus Christ. Our partners have committed to living out this mission by worshipping Christ, living in community, getting trained for ministry and making disciples together over time. We ask our partners to uphold some key commitments with this mission in mind and to actively be the church for their city.</p>
